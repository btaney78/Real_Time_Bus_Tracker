# Real_Time_Bus_Tracker
This program tracks in real time all the buses running the Bus 1 route between the Harvard and MIT campuses. The program pulls data on a loop from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) V3 API Portal, and loads the data onto a Google Map via the Google Maps Javascript API.
